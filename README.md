# Climate_Analysis

This repository was created by Thu Pham and myself
to help Michael Lerner teach a class at Earlham. 
The code was adapted from Randy Olsen's project found 
here (http://www.randalolson.com/2015/08/13/the-new-york-times-weather-chart-redux/).

We encountered a few difficulties because many of the cities we were modeling were missing data.
We ammended the parser to circumvent this problem.

We wrote the csvMERGER found in the CSVTools.py to avoid having to replace data by hand.
The wundergroundVisualization can then be used to create the images from the csv files.
